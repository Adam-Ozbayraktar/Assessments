# Data engineering exercise
### Setting
At BluNova you will be working with live data sources which run and evolve independent to us. We are looking for someone with a keen eye for detail which will assist with building robust pipelines that can handle changes over time. We treat ETL as a continuous evolving process and acknowledge that there will always be new surprises around every corner.
### Instructions
1. Suppose you are given the clean set and told to build an ETL pipeline.
2. A few weeks later a data scientist comes to you in a panic stating all the data is wrong. Looking at the dirty set identify what went wrong and suggest some remedial measures to refactor your data pipeline to be robust. This is an open ended question so look at the data and imagine some scenario of your own as well.
3. Rather than coding up the solution please provide a document with your findings.

Good luck.
